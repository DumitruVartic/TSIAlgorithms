# TSIAlgorithms
## Encryption and Digital Signature Project

This project was developed as part of the Technologies of Information Security course at UTM. It implements symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms, as well as digital signature functionality. The project is built using C# WinForms for the user interface.

## Algorithms

The project includes the following algorithms:

- DES (Data Encryption Standard): Used for symmetric encryption and decryption.
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): Used for symmetric encryption and decryption.
- RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman): Used for digital signature generation and verification.

## User Interface

The project utilizes C# WinForms for the graphical user interface (GUI), providing an intuitive way to interact with the implemented algorithms. The interface allows users to input the necessary data, choose the desired algorithm, and perform encryption, decryption, and digital signature operations.
